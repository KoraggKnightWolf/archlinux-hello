archlinux-hello
=============


WIP: English language file completely done, German one partially, others will not be altered.

A tool providing access to documentation and support for new Arch Linux users.

## What is Arch Linux Hello?

Archlinux-hello will generate a window with links/shortcuts to various sources, websites etc to obtain further information
and knowledge about Arch Linux.

Archlinux-hello is widely inspired by [manjaro-hello](https://github.com/manjaro/manjaro-hello).
Currently, archlinux-hello has all the major features of manjaro-hello, but with limited translations.
- Interface is translated using gettext and po files (po/). Only german and english files will be adapted for archlinux-hello!
- Pages are translated using differents files (data/pages).

## What goals ?

The goal of the project is to build a powerful user interface that allows the user to discover his favorite distribution :).

## Technologies

Archlinux-hello is build with Python, Gtk3 and Glade.

## TODO

- Make more translations to distribute it in all the world.
